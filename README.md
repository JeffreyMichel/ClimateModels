## Introduction

Climate models are essential tools for understanding the Earth's climate system and predicting future changes. This repository contains a set of climate models developed using various techniques taught in the Coursera course. The models cover a range of topics including atmospheric circulation, ocean dynamics, greenhouse gas concentrations, and climate feedback mechanisms.

## Usage

To use the climate models in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine (git clone https://github.com/yourusername/climate-models.git)
2. Navigate to the directory containing the desired model.
3. Follow the instructions provided in the model's README file to run the simulation and analyze the results.

## Models

### 1. Atmospheric Circulation Model

- **Description:** This model simulates the global atmospheric circulation patterns using simplified equations of motion.
- **Features:** Includes options to visualize wind patterns, pressure systems, and precipitation distribution.
- **Dependencies:** Requires Python 3 and Matplotlib library.

### 2. Ocean Dynamics Model

- **Description:** This model simulates the movement of ocean currents and the distribution of heat in the ocean.
- **Features:** Allows users to explore the effects of factors such as temperature gradients and oceanic topography.
- **Dependencies:** Requires MATLAB or Python with NumPy library.

### 3. Carbon Cycle Model

- **Description:** This model simulates the flow of carbon between the atmosphere, oceans, and terrestrial ecosystems.
- **Features:** Includes options to adjust carbon emissions, land use changes, and carbon sequestration rates.
- **Dependencies:** Requires Python 3 and Pandas library.
