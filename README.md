## Introduction

Climate models are essential tools for understanding the Earth's climate system and predicting future changes. This repository contains a set of climate models developed using various techniques taught in the Coursera course. The models cover a range of topics including atmospheric circulation, ocean dynamics, greenhouse gas concentrations, and climate feedback mechanisms.

## Usage

To use the climate models in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine (git clone https://github.com/yourusername/climate-models.git)
2. Navigate to the directory containing the desired model.
3. Follow the instructions provided in the model's README file to run the simulation and analyze the results.

## Models

### 1. Pane of Glass model

- **Description:** This model simulates the global atmospheric temperature assuming that the atmosphere is the same as a pane of glass, emitting in two directions: up and down.
- **Features:** Produces a graph to demostrate equilibrium time frame as well as outputting the equlibrium temperature.
- **Dependencies:** Requires Python 3 and Matplotlib library.
